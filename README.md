## Inspiration
Our inspiration came from the love of travel and finding out more about the world and about people's interests!

## What it does
The app/webapp takes in your location, budget for activities and what sort of attractions you are interested in (whether it be main attractions or hidden gems); it will then output the most popular and best rated locations for activites. After you are done that activity, you can take a selfie and post it, Azure's cognitave services will then map out a rating of that location based on your emotions in that photo.

## How we built it
We used Azure's storage for storing all information adding on to the database of locations visited and reviews to give a better activity/location suggestion for the next user.

## Challenges we ran into
Some challenges included coming up with the idea, connecting to Azure's services as well as getting the server up and running.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
Making an app that included many API's and services, learning about Azure, learning about machine learning, and lastly deploying our website on Azure through github.

## What we learned
Azure, Node, JQuery

## What's next for MyVenture
Using Azure's machine learning to analyze previous travel data sets and making suggestions based off of these patterns instead on first accumulating a database through individual users.
